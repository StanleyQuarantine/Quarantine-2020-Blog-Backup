        <h2 class="titles"><em>When</em> did you start learning HTML?</h2>
        <p> I started in Late May, 2020. Quarantine turned me to it. I've always wanted to learn. I picked it up one afternoon in between classes. I used <a href="codecademy.com" target="_blank" style="color:whitesmoke">Codecademy</a> as my primary way to learn HTML, CSS, and hopefully Javascript. Woohoo!</p>
