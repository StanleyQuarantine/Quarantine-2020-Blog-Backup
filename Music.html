        <h2 id="titles">What music do you like?</h2>
          <p>I like Ska, Metal, Hip-Hop, Spanish music such as Banda and Reggaeton. I also enjoy some smooth jazz from time to time. It's an odd combo, but it's relaxing to me. It also highly depends on the mood that I am feeling. If I want to be up and focused, Ska works for me. If I need to focus, Lo-fi Hip-Hop works well.</p>
