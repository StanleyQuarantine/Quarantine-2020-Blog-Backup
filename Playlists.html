          <p>Are you interested in Ska? I love Mustard Plug. They're a Ska band from Colorado, and they are a more traditional Ska band, utilizing the usual upbeat tempos, brass, and it is typical skanking music. I got to see them at the <strong>"Back to the Beach" Festival</strong> and they played two of my favorite songs, <strong>Beer</strong> and <strong>Mr. Smiley</strong>. Mr. Smiley is the song that got me looking more into their music. </p>
