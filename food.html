        <h2 id="titles">What kind of food do you like?</h2>
          <p>That is a difficult question to answer. Although I do often think about fried chicken often. From Popeyes, to Raising Canes, to Korean Fried Chicken, I love it all!</p>

          <h3 id="">Popeyes</h3>
            <p>I LOVE POPEYES. Dude, if you download the app theres tons of deals on there that will cater to anything you would ever want. The $8 meal deal for two slaps. You get like 6 tenders, 2 biscuits, and 2 sides. It's incredible! The picture below isn't the deal, lol. Its just a picture of Popeyes chicken.</p>
